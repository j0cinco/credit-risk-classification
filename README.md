# credit-risk-classification

An overview of the analysis: the purpose of this exercise was to train and analyze a model based on loan risk. The data used in this assignment was stored in a csv and required importing the information into a dataframe. After splitting the data and fitting it to a logistic regression model, we discovered the results below. 

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
Original Data
- Accuracy: 99%
- Precision: Healthy loans = 100%. High-risk loans = 87%
- Recall: Healthy loans = 100%. High risk loaks = 89%

Resampled Data
- Accuracy: 100%
- Precision: Healthy loans = 100%. High-risk loans = 87%
- Recall: Healthy loans = 100%. High risk loaks = 100%

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

Both models resulted in higher accuracy scores and are good predictors of healthy vs high-risk loans. However, the recall scores from Machine Learning Model 2 truly separates itself. If a recommendation were to be made, I would suggest going with Machine Learning Model 2 since the quality of the results were better and it gives the user a better confidence in loan application decision making.
